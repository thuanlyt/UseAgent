# Checkpoint: docs-hosting-gate-final-v17

- **Created:** 2026-09-04T07:54:29Z
- **Status:** needs_input
- **Agent:** supervisor
- **Next action:** When browser UI automation and exact production hostname/authenticated Vercel/Cloudflare access are available, complete UA-0012 visual/accessibility review and separately authorized hosting/DNS operations. Until then, continue bounded local verification only.

## Summary

Core state machine hardening is green after UA-0028: done/cancelled are terminal, 27 tasks done, 39 tests pass, QA/validation/docs build pass; UA-0012 remains the sole docs-hosting gate.

## Tasks

- `UA-0012`
- none

## Blockers and risks

- Browser UI automation kernel still fails at initialization with: failed to write kernel assets (os error 3); real visual/accessibility evidence is missing.
- Exact production hostname and authenticated Vercel/Cloudflare access are unavailable; no remote deployment or DNS mutation was performed.
- none

## Resume instructions

When browser UI automation and exact production hostname/authenticated Vercel/Cloudflare access are available, complete UA-0012 visual/accessibility review and separately authorized hosting/DNS operations. Until then, continue bounded local verification only.
